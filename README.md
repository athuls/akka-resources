1) Scalable Spreadsheets for Interactive Data Analysis: In interactive data-centric applications, the scalability could come from the amount of data that needs to be manipulated and the complex queries that need to be done on the data (not necessarily scale on the number of clients/users accessing the data. Also we can look at integrating different data sources on the backend, while the spreadsheet provides the visual interface for manipulating it (the message interface in actors could be used here).
